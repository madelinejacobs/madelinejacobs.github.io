            <p>If you are not aware, Emily Dickinson was a poet from Amherst, Massechusetts in the middle 19th century </p>
            <ul>
                <li>nothing in her love life is "confirmed" at all</li>
                <li>but things are so known that they are just (known)</li>
                <li>despite her lack of a public love life, Dickinson wrote a LOT of love poems/letters</li>
                <li>and sure some her notconfirmed love interests were males....but</li>
                <li>a couple of those uncomfirmed love intersts were thought to be women</li>
                <li>one of those suspects was Susan Huntinton Gilbert, who was her sister-in-law and friend from school</li>
                <li>another was a friend Catherine Scott Turner Anthon</li>
                <li>anyone interested should watch Dickinson, it is a show about Emily Dickinson's life and her relationship with Sue, my friends made me watch it and i got bored and didn't end up finishing it because my apple tv free trial ended, but maybe you will like it.</li>

            <p>Leonardo Da Vinci was a famous polymath guy during the renaissance in Italy. He is not to be confused with Leonardo Decaprio, however both are insanely creepy. </p>
            <ul>
                <li>I want to emphasize that Da Vinci's love life was so not good and wrong on so many levels</li>
                <li>"oh but it was normal during that time so its okay!".....no</li>
                <li>no its still very creepy</li>
                <li>Da Vinci had two known relationships with two of his assistants</li>
                <li>Gian Giacomo Caprotti was one of them, he started to apprentence with Da Vinci when he was 10, and got the nickname Salai which means "devil" </li>
                <li>Caprotti stayed with Da Vinci for 25 more years</li>
                <li>The other boy was named Francesco Melz and came from a noble family when he was just 14</li>
                <li>Melzi stayed with Da Vinci until he died, and ended up inheriting the majority of Da Vinci's legacy</li>
                <li>Apparently adult men and teenager boy relationships were so normalized in Florence that "Florenzer" became the slang for same-sex relationships</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Florence Nightingale was major player in making modern nursing as well as a statisician</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Florence was born into a wealthy Italian family in 1820</li>
                <li>and instead of marrying a wealthy man, Florence ran off to become a nurse</li>
                <li>Which she became so good at that she got recruited to help the British soilders injured from the Crimean War against the Russian empire</li>
                <li>and because she is so amazing, she reduced the hospitals death rates by 2/3, yeah</li>
                <li>The British government gave her 250,000 as a reward</li>
                <li>With her money she funded a whole hospital and with it a whole nursing program</li>
                <li>And with support of Queen Victoria, she became the first female member of the Royal Statistical Society and was named an honorary member of the American Statistical Association.</li>
                <li>tldr she is a badass</li>
                <li>onto the gay part</li>
                <li>which is a little......eeeeeee....not great and not badass at all so just like seperated this information from the rest of her..</li>
                <li>love letters have been found to Florence's cousin Marinna Nicholson</li>
                <li>and there have been reports of her also in relationships with her aunt and other cousin, Hillary</li>
                <li>do will that what you will</li>

            <h3 style = "font-family:monospace">Oscar Wilde</h3>
            <image src = "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/92/Oscar_Wilde_3g07095u-adjust.jpg" width = "100 px">
            <p>Oscar Fingal O'Flahertie Wills Wilde was a Irish author</p>
            <ul>
                <li> Wilde was one of the most popular playwrights in London in thee 1890's</li>
                <li>He was the writer of many famous plays like Lady Windermere's Fan</li>
                <li>also the author of The Picture of Dorian Gray</li>
                <li>Wilde wrote most of his famous pieces in just the last decade of his life</li>
                <li>He married Constance Lloyd and had two children</li>
                <li>However,.....he had a long term boyfriend on the side</li>
                <li>Lord Alfred Douglas (the boyfriend) did not get along with Oscar's dad and actually convinces Oscar to sue him for crimial libel</li>
                <li>criminal libel : a malicious, defamatory statement in a permanent form, rendering the maker liable to criminal prosecution</li>
                <li>but oscar did not win that trial, and the evidence was flipped against him  and actually went to jail himself for two years</li>
                <li>so moral of the story, don't date a guy who convinces you to sue your dad because you will go to jail</li>
